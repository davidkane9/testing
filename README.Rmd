The purpose of this package is to provide a reproducible example of a problem with installing the `rstanarm` package using Github Actions, and the resulting failure of R CMD check on Github, even for a package which works fine locally.

1) In the DESCRIPTION we have:

````
Remotes: 
    tidyverse/readr   
````

My actual problem is with one of my own Github packages, but I wanted to use a high quality Github package for the example.

2) My tests/testthat/test-ex.R file looks like:

````
library(readr)

expect_equal(my_function("2"),
             "2")
````

`my_function()` just returns the input. The whole packages passes R CMD check locally with no WARNINGS/ERRORS.

3) The package was created with all the (wonderful!) **usethis** tools, including `usethis::use_github_actions()`. But when the R CMD check [runs](), via Github Actions, on Github, we see this error:

````
* checking for unstated dependencies in ‘tests’ ... WARNING
Warning: 'library' or 'require' call not declared from: ‘readr’
* checking tests ...
  Running ‘testthat.R’
 ERROR
Running the tests in ‘tests/testthat.R’ failed.

It is as if `rstanarm`` is never installed, despite its placement in the DESCRIPTION file. This is consistent with what I see in the [log file]():

````
Install/update packages
  ℹ Installing lockfile '.github/pkg.lock'
   
  → Will install 38 packages.
  → Will download 37 CRAN packages (10.03 MB).
  → Will download 1 package with unknown size.
````  


Any ideas much appreciated!

## Installation

You can install the development version of testing from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
